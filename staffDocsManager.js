      `> Staff members must maintain a calm, objective, and mature demeanor in all interactions. Arguing with community members, engaging in public toxicity, or reacting defensively during administrative disputes will not be tolerated under any circumstances.\n\n` +
      `### S2. Activity Requirements\n` +
      `> All staff members must attend a minimum of three (3) official server sessions weekly and maintain an active presence across Discord ticket channels. If personal obligations prevent you from fulfilling your quota, you are required to submit an official Leave of Absence via \`-loa\` prior to inactivity.\n\n` +
      `### S3. Neutrality & Impartiality\n` +
      `> Staff members are strictly prohibited from showing bias, favoritism, or leniency toward friends, faction members, or department colleagues. Decisions must be grounded entirely on verifiable evidence and established server rules.\n\n` +
      `### S4. Abuse of Administrative Power\n` +
      `> In-game commands (including teleportation, vehicle spawning, health overrides, and respawning) may only be utilized strictly for active administrative duty. Utilizing staff privileges to gain in-character advantages during pursuits, shootouts, or criminal scenarios results in immediate termination and server blacklisting.\n\n` +
      `### S5. Confidentiality & Security\n` +

      `> 2. Teleport to the reporting player using discreet positioning to avoid disrupting ongoing realistic scenes.\n` +
      `> 3. If a scene requires immediate administrative pause, freeze the involved parties and communicate via administrative private message.\n\n` +
      `### M2. Proof & Evidence Verification Standard\n` +
      `> Disciplinary actions exceeding verbal warnings require verifiable evidence (unaltered video recordings or direct staff observation). Verbal claims from reporting players are insufficient grounds for kicks or bans. If evidence cannot be produced, advise the player to document future encounters.\n\n` +
      `### M3. Discord Ticket Handling\n` +
      `> Staff members must claim support tickets promptly. Read the inquiry completely before responding, communicate with formal grammar, and ensure all user questions are answered prior to initiating ticket closure. Do not leave tickets unclaimed for more than five (5) minutes.\n\n` +
      `### M4. In-Game Roleplay Prioritization\n` +

      `> • **Level 2 (First Strike):**\n` +

      `> • **Level 3 (Second Strike):**\n` +

      `> • **Level 4 (Third Strike / Demotion / Removal):**\n` +
      `> Reaching three active strikes results in immediate demotion or permanent removal from the ERLCX staff team.\n\n` +
      `### Strike Expiration Timeline\n` +
      `> Strikes remain active on a staff member's record for forty-five (45) consecutive days from the date of issuance. Following 45 days of clean and active service, the strike is removed from the active count.\n\n` +
